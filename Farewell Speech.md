When we arrived here, we didn’t come as finished people. We came as raw material — shaped by habits we didn’t choose, beliefs we hadn’t questioned, and expectations already placed on us. This place didn’t just teach us; it *collided* with us. And collisions, by nature, aren’t always gentle.

Before going further, I want to pause and acknowledge something honestly: to many of you, I might still feel like a stranger.

Not because we never shared space — we did, every day — but because I was never very performative. I didn’t always speak the loudest, didn’t always fit into visible categories, didn’t always project a version of myself that was easy to understand. And in that sense, I know I’m not alone. Many students move through academic spaces being present, but never truly *known*.

And that leads to a deeper reality of education itself. Teachers are expected to shape students — but shaping without knowing is always incomplete. Even with the best intentions, it’s difficult to guide a mind without understanding the life attached to it. Most students carry stories that never enter the classroom — responsibilities, pressures, fears, ambitions they don’t know how to express. When those stories remain invisible, misunderstandings are born — not from cruelty, but from distance.

Understanding this changed how I experienced everything else that followed.

Because over time, I realized something uncomfortable: growth rarely feels noble while it’s happening. It often feels confusing, irritating, even pointless. There were moments I felt disconnected — from people, from ideas, from the system itself. Moments of hate, moments of cringe, moments where I questioned not just *what* was being taught, but *why* it was being done that way at all.

At first, I resisted those feelings. I treated them like errors — signs that something was wrong. But slowly, another thought emerged: maybe even discomfort carries meaning. Maybe hate isn’t always meaningless. Maybe cringe exists because something inside us is being challenged, disturbed, or exposed.

And that’s when I realized — not everything here inspired me, but almost everything made me *think*. And that matters.

Looking back, this journey was never one-sided. It wasn’t purely nurturing, and it wasn’t purely restrictive. It lived in a constant tension — between freedom and discipline, curiosity and conformity. Teachers, friends, rules, routines — all played their role. Some moments felt encouraging, others limiting. But both pushed reflection, and reflection is where understanding begins.

There were times when the system — and sometimes even teachers within it — created problems. Pressure without explanation. Rules without dialogue. Authority without empathy. But at some point, I stopped receiving these moments as personal attacks. Instead, I began to see them as *stories* — stories shaped by their own constraints, fears, training, and experiences.

What looked like control was sometimes insecurity.
What felt like rigidity was sometimes survival.
What appeared as indifference was sometimes exhaustion.

That shift didn’t erase the problems — but it changed my relationship with them. I stopped internalizing them as judgments on my worth.

In the middle of all this, friendships formed — not just as comfort, but as contrast. Different mindsets, different priorities, different ways of seeing the world. Agreement wasn’t always necessary. In fact, friction often taught more than comfort ever could.

And this brings me to our teachers — not with criticism, but with a request. Students don’t only need instruction; they need space. Space to question without fear, to disagree without being dismissed, to think beyond answers and into reasons. You already shape minds every day; sometimes, allowing those minds to challenge you back is part of that shaping.

Now, to the people leaving with me — my fellow students — because what comes next belongs to us.

As we step out, we’ll hear a lot about being *independent*. Society celebrates it — self-made, self-sufficient, self-reliant. Independence matters. It gives us agency and responsibility. But independence without awareness slowly turns into isolation.

No one grows alone. Every outcome is shared — shaped by timing, people, systems, and chance. That’s interdependence. And between these two ideas lies a quieter truth we often forget: **every individual contributes a percentage**.

Nothing is entirely you — and nothing happens without you being something.

Thinking it’s all you leads to arrogance.
Thinking you’re nothing leads to silence.

Both miss reality.

You matter — but you are not the whole equation.
Others matter — but they don’t erase your role.

This way of thinking also changes how we judge the world.

We often think in absolutes — perfect or useless, right or wrong, best or worst. But reality rarely works at 100%. Most of life follows something closer to an *80–20 rule*. If something looks perfect, there’s usually a 20% imperfection hidden beneath it. If something looks beautiful, there’s usually 20% ugliness we choose not to see.

No system is completely broken.
No system is completely flawless.

No teacher is 100% wrong.
No student is 100% right.

And I’m not saying we shouldn’t value the 80%. We should. That’s what works, what holds things together. But wisdom comes from *also* noticing the 20% — not to complain, but to understand. Not to reject, but to improve.

Ignoring the 20% creates blind faith.
Obsessing over it creates bitterness.
Seeing both creates clarity.

As we move forward, life will try to simplify itself for us. It will tell us success has one shape, goals have one timeline, and approval equals worth. I don’t believe that. Life feels less like reaching destinations and more like staying conscious while moving.

Goals are tools, not identities.
Failure isn’t weakness — it’s information.
Love isn’t possession — it’s understanding without control.
And death doesn’t give life meaning by fear, but by urgency.

So don’t rush to become acceptable.
Don’t confuse noise with purpose.
And don’t be afraid to question what everyone else seems comfortable accepting.

Now, as we stand at the end of this chapter, it doesn’t feel like closure. It feels like transfer. Not from order to freedom, but from one system to another — larger, harsher, and far less forgiving.

The truth is, we aren’t leaving systems behind. We’re graduating into a bigger one. One with deeper inequalities, stronger hierarchies, louder expectations, and fewer explanations. The same patterns — pressure, comparison, authority, conformity — just scaled up and disguised as choice.

If this place ever felt flawed, the world outside won’t be kinder by default. It will demand productivity before understanding, results before growth, and labels before identity. And just like here, it will often confuse control with structure and silence with discipline.

That’s not pessimism. That’s acceptance.

Because whether we like it or not, this is the only direction forward. There is no outside of the system — only movement within it. And pretending otherwise only leaves us unprepared.

So this farewell isn’t about relief. It’s about awareness. About knowing that the discomfort doesn’t end here — it evolves. And the thinking we practiced here isn’t optional anymore; it’s necessary.

But acceptance doesn’t mean surrender.

If systems were unchangeable, history would be static. Every flawed structure we inherit exists not because it is perfect, but because it hasn’t yet been transformed by those who questioned it deeply enough and stayed long enough to act.

We may not escape the system —
but we can reshape parts of it.
Slowly. Imperfectly. Collectively.

And maybe that’s the quiet responsibility we carry forward: not to remain victims of the same patterns we recognize, and not to become the same voices we once questioned.

So as we leave, let’s not carry illusions.
But let’s not carry hopelessness either.

We’re not stepping out of a flawed world.
We’re stepping deeper into it —
with eyes open,
with questions alive,
and with the possibility that we won’t let it remain exactly as it is.

Thank you.
