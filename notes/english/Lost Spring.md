### Anees Jung

Anees Jung, the narrator and author, is a sensitive and observant social commentator. She is empathetic and builds trust, allowing people like Saheb and Mukesh to share their stories. She is not just a passive observer; she questions injustices and expresses deep anguish over the broken dreams of poor children. Her writing is reflective, highlighting the contract between hope and harsh reality. She acts as a compassionate voice for the marginalized, exposing the cycle of poverty and lost childhood.

### Saheb-e-Alam

<mark>Saheb is a young ragpicker who lives in Seemapuri, a slum on the outskirt of Delhi. He is originally from Dhaka (Bangladesh)</mark>, forced to migrate India due to storms that destroyed his home and fields.

Saheb's life is defined by extreme poverty. His daily routine involves scouring garbage dumps with a plastic bag, looking for anything of value. Despite his harsh reality, he carries an innocent smile and hopes for a better life. He is named *Saheb-e-Alam* which means "lord of the universe", a cruel irony given his circumstances.

He dreams of going to school, playing tennis, and wearing shoes; simple things that are out of his reach. When he later starts working at a tea stall, he loses his carefree wandering. He is no longer his own master. The steel canister he carries, feels heavy, symbolising the crushing weight of lost childhood and trapped dreams.
